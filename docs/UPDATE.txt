Updating AM Events to the latest version.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading to v0.21
==================

.:IMPORTANT:. 
This release has some database structure changes over the previous release, and
requires an update script to be run (more on this later). Because of this update
you may wish to turn the site off as visitors may experience problems until the
update is complete.

Upload the AM Events folder into the modules folder on your web site, 
over-writing existing files. Next navigate to the Modules admin area, and update
AM Events by clicking the update icon next to its listing.

As mentioned above, a separate script is provided to update the database. This
is to save you from removing and re-installing AM Events, then having to 
manually re-add any events (although, you may have to tweak some of the display
settings). To do this, go to:

 http://www.the-url-of-your-site.com/modules/amevents/update0.21.php
 
All you need do is to click the button. A backup of the existing event data 
table will be created and called "<prefix>_amevents_events_bak019" (where 
<prefix> is the prefix to the table name defined when you installed XOOPS). You 
can delete this at your leisure, but it may be worth checking the update is 
working first. Please delete the update script when you are finished.



Upgrading to v0.19a
==================

There are no database structure changes in this release, but there 
are many more countries included, which can be added to existing 
installs.

 - Unpack the .zip or .tar.gz version of the archive you have 
   downloaded and upload the folder called "amevents" to your
   web space. If asked, over-write any existing files.
 - Go to your Admin area, then: System -> Modules, click on the
   "upgrade" icon to the right of the AM Events listing, and follow
   the instructions.
 - If you want to add 200+ countries to the drop-down list, go to
   http://www.yoursitesurl.com/modules/amevents/update/update_countries.php
   This will add all of the countries listed in xoops_amevents_country.csv
   in the update folder.
   You don't have to run this if you don't want to, or you can edit 
   the CVS to suit your needs - just as long as it stays in the same 
   format of a semi-colon delimited file, e.g., 
   "country name";"country code"
 - Remove the "update" folder and files.

This list was taken from the ISO's list of 2 digit country codes - I
apologise that it's only in English now, but I will adapt it so it
can be localised in the future.

The script checks to see if a country has already been added by 
checking against the 2 digit country code, so will not add or over-
write any countries already added with an identical code.

There is no need to run this script if you have installed for the 
first time.
