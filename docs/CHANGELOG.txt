AM Events update history log
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Key:
 + Added feature.
 - Removed.
 ! Bug fix.
 o General comment.


AM Events v0.22:
================
 
 ! Made a small change to the upcoming events block's options so that the date
   is displayed correctly in XOOPS 2.2.
 ! Fix a buglet where the "see all events" and "submit events" links would not 
   be shown in the upcoming events module, if there were no events to display.
 o Re-written mini-calendar to make less hits to the database.
 o Added class for mini-calendar main table, it has no properties yet, but you
   can add them if you want.
 + Added DHTML pop ups to mini-calendar date links, this is handy where there 
   are two or more events on one day.
 
 
AM Events v0.21:
================

 ! Events would originally have expired at the start of the day at which the 
   event ended, this has now been changed so it should end at end of the day.
 + User's posts will now show up in their profile.
 + Author can now be changed. Either when posted by admin, or when edited.
 o Changed some XOOPS depreciated functions.
 + Added date ends column in event list admin, and to validate list.
 ! "Ended" status/link in admin events listing now goes by date/time end and not
   Start.
 o If event only on one day, the end date will now be set to the "start" date, 
   and time set to 23:59:59, so it will time out at the end of day. This is to 
   help with expiring events at a more appropriate time.
 + Now supports WYSIWYG editors.
 o Changed event_description type to MEDIUMTEXT to prevent problems with event 
   text being truncated.
 + User submit function can now be disabled (submit links in menu and blocks 
   will be hidden when disabled).
 + Events can now be auto approved (added without admin having to check).
 + Events that have expired can now be left on view.
 ! Changed expire SQL code in block.
 + There is now a separate admin notification for auto approved events.
 + New notification of events for users.
 o Added a "no events to display" message to main listing page.

 
AM Events v0.20:
================

 + Changed index/print links at foot of item to icon images.
 + Added added edit and delete links and icons to event page.
 o Event name now displays in header bar on item page.
 + Can now display event name in browser title.
 + Added "posted by" and username (item page).
 o Tidied language constants to help prevent clashes, and make translating 
   easier.
 + Added missing URL field to print.php
 + Added language constants to print.php
 + Made printable version optional from prefs.
 + Changed user submit form to XOOPs form lib with its pop-up calendar.
 o Changed user submit confirm message.
 o Changed over to XOOPS own built in date format function (this removes the 
   function name clash with wf-sections).
 o changed from "shorthand" php echo (<?=$var?>) to prevent problems on servers
   where this is not allowed.
 ! Fixed cancel delete bug in eventadmin.php - pressing cancel would report 
   event being deleted.
 
 
AM Events v0.19:
================

 + Updated module logo.
 + Created a script to update countries - there are now over 200, so just about
   everywhere should be more or less covered. 
 + Added flags for new countries, although not all are available yet.

================

   validate page.
